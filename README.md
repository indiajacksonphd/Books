# Welcome

The books in this repository are all written by India Jackson, PhD and are open for public use, even commercially, so long as proper attribution/credit is given to the author. I'm in the process of learning, so if there are any mistakes in my books or if you see your work and I haven't given proper credit, please reach out to me immediately at indiajacksonphd@gmail.com.

While all of my books are free, I'm happy to take any donations for the hardwork that I put in:
